For some reason I couldn't get into the Railo Server admin on my dev box. The password was the same one I use for all my important accounts, password123!
<p>To reset it, find railo-server.xml. On my Railo 4.2.1 Express it was here <i>RAILO_INSTALL/lib/ext/railo-server/context/railo-server.xml</i>.</p>    <p>The root node contains a <i>pw</i> attribute:</p>    <pre class="code">&lt;railo-configuration pw="hashed-password-here" version="4.2"$gt;</pre>    <p>Set that to <i>pw=""</i> and visit your admin page here http://domain/railo-context/admin/server.cfm where you'll be asked to enter a new one.</p>    <p>Or just remember it next time! Pass. Word. One. Two. Three.</p>
