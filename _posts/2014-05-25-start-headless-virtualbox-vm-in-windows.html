A command to fire up a virtual machine without the associated GUI that comes with it when started via the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.
<p>Navigate to your VirtualBox install directory:</p>    <pre class="code">  cd "\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox"  </pre>    <p>Then fire up a VM with:</p>    <pre class="code">  VBoxManage startvm "Testing Server" --type headless  </pre>    <p><b>Update:</b> Since VirtualBox 4.2, holding down shift whilst clicking Start starts the VM headless. Why this couldn't be put in the menu somewhere, I don't know!</p>
