title: Quick access to your hosts file
summary: I access my hosts file every now and then. So after the third or fourth time of navigating down the "WINDOWS, system32, what was it next?" route, I created a batch file to make it a 3 second job.

<p>I access my hosts file every now and then. So after the third or fourth time of navigating down the "WINDOWS, system32, what was it next?" route, I created a batch file to make it a 3 second job.</p>
<p>If you use your hosts file for local development, or if a domain name hasn't propergated and you can't wait, this could be of interest to you.</p>    <ol>   <li>Create a new text file and save it as <strong>hosts.bat</strong></li>   <li>Find your host file, which for me on Windows XP Pro and Vista is in <strong>C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\</strong></li>   <li>Add the following line to the batch file making sure it points to the where ever your hosts file is: <strong>notepad C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</strong></li>   <li>Save the batch file and move it to <strong>C:\WINDOWS\system32\</strong></li>   <li>Now click Start &gt; Run &gt; then type <strong>hosts</strong> and press return</li>  </ol>    <p>As you can imagine, you can use this technique for all sorts of other shortcuts, stopping and starting services, opening up files in the deepest of directory structure etc.</p>
