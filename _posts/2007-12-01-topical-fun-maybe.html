title: Topical fun? Maybe!
---

<p>I got sent an email which asked what you had got up to over the last year. This site takes that idea and serves it up in a nice, fun little package. Each of your &quot;crimes&quot; will cost you a fine. Go through the list admitting to all the bad things you've done and at the end, see how much you owe.</p>
  <p>Aptly named <a href="http://www.dirtybungle.co.uk">Dirty Bungle</a>!</p>
    <p>A work in progress but fun all the same.</p>
