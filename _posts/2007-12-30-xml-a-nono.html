<p>You can't name your XML element begining with XML!</p>    <p>Scroll to the Element Naming section on this page on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp">W3Schools to see some more on naming your XML elements</a>.</p>    <p>This was asked on <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/thread.cfm/threadid:54653">CF-Talk</a> and answered by <a href="http://fusion.dominicwatson.co.uk/">Dominic Watson</a>.</p>    <p>I wonder if there's anything else I don't know?! :OS</p>
