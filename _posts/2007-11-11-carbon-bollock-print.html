What do you do when friends collide?
<p>You're on your way out, say to the cinema, when you realise you've invited friends from two different groups. You like them all, else they'd not be your friends, but you know that they might not get on with each other. What to do?</p>  <p>Bob has recently split with his girlfriend. Sally has recently started seeing someone. Bob likes the look of Sally, and why not, she nice*.</p>  <p>You've know Sally for a while now. She's awesome. You've know Bob for ages. He too is awesome. Would you like him to date your sister? Hell no!</p>  <p>As dudes with dude friends, we tend to know a lot about their sexual conquests and relationships. This is ok most of the time because they aren't hot-dogging on your friend. But what about 'When Friends Collide'?!</p>  <p>What's with the title you ask? I thought it was funny...</p>  <p>... at the time.</p>  <p>* Borat Sagdiyev</p>
