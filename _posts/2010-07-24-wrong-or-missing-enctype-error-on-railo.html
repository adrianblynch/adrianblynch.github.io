title: Wrong or missing enctype error on Railo
---

<p>Railo simply states:</p>
    <pre style="background: #ff9; padding: 15px;">Form field [fileData] doesn't exist or has no content</pre>    <p>Which makes me think I've spelled the form field incorrectly or that I've uploaded an empty file.</p>
    <p>A message saying wrong enctype would surely work out better?!</p>
