<p>You right-click on a folder and there's no security tab!</p>
<p>Then you probably have 'Use simple file sharing' enabled.</p>    <p>Go to Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View, scroll to the bottom of the list and uncheck 'Use simple file sharing'</p>    <p>The security tab should now appear in the directory's properties dialog box.</p>
