title: ColdFusion error database site
---

<p>The idea is that you can search <a href="http://cferror.org/" title="ColdFusion errors">cferror.org</a> for part of the error message and if it has an entry, an explanation sits along side it.</p>
    <p>There is a form for people to <a href="http://cferror.org/submit.cfm">upload errors</a> along with a code sample and a solution if they know it.</p>
    <p><a href="http://cferror.org/" title="ColdFusion errors">cferror.org</a> will hopefully grow to contain lots of the errors that have people scratching their heads.</p>
    <p>There are still a few things to be done on the site but it'll grow in functionality as we see how people are using it.</p>
