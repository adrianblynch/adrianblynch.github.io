title: Path variables in Java (Railo)
---

<p>I knew it was due to caching but I wanted to make sure the JVM was indeed caching the path variable.</p>
<pre class="code">   path = createObject("java", "java.lang.System").getenv("PATH");   dump(path.listToArray(";"));  </pre>    <p>This proved the change I has made wasn't being picked up.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a way to refresh this so I ended up reboot my machine which meant the changed were picked up.</p>
