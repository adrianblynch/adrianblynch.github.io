<p>I've forgotten this more than once so it's getting posted here.</p>
<p>To get cfqueryparam to work properly with NVARCHAR columns in SQL Server, go into the datasource advanced options section and tick the following option:</p>  <p style="background: #ff9; padding: 15px;">Enable High ASCII characters and Unicode for data sources configured for non-Latin characters</p>  <p>There's no need to try and use N'' in the SQL as it's all taken care of for you.</p>
